## Description 
In this project I was tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company, based on the provided financial dataset including profit/losses over months.

### Solution
I've looped through the data set to calculate profits/losses over the entire period, changes from month to month, average changes over the period and the greatest decrease and increase in profits/losses. 

### Challenges
One of the main challenges was accounting for the lack of p/l changes in month 1, which affected calculations of the average changes over the entire period.

## Usage
The code prints the analysis to the console.
